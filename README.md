Game jam at concentric 2013

A networked 2 player card game, based around medieval corgis battling to the death.

So start the server, run:

```
./go.sh
```

from within the corgi-cards/ directory.

To play, connect to localhost:8142 using 2 different windows.

Once you've reached the game landing page, follow the steps below to get start (this was a hackathon, so user friendliness was not at the forefront of our development):
1. On the first window, enter a username into the "username" input box, and hit enter
2. On the first window, enter a room number/name into the "room" input box, and hit enter
3. On the second window, enter a username into the "username" input box, and hit enter
4. On the second window, enter a room number/name into the "room" input box, and hit enter

This will launch a room of the game for the two active windows.

#Rules

Each player may increment their magic, or strength resource once per turn, by click on the icon on your side of the screen (the lightning bolt, and the fist)

You may spend all of your accumulated resource each turn, and it will relpenish at the start of each of your turns.

To target a corgi character, click on your own corgi character first, and click on the target character second. Similarily to target a player with a character or a spell, click on the target or spell, and then click on the desired target player's colored circle in the top corner.
